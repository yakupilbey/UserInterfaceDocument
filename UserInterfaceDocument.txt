# User Management Screen User Interface Specification

## Overview

The User Management Screen is a part of the administration panel of the application. It allows administrators to manage users, including creating new users and editing existing users.

## Requirements

1. Provide input fields to enter user details: username, display name, phone, email, user roles, and enabled status.
2. Allow administrators to select user roles from a predefined list (Guest, Admin, SuperAdmin).
3. Validate input fields to ensure data integrity.
4. Provide functionality to create a new user.
5. Show appropriate error messages if any operation fails.

## UI Components and Behavior

### New User Form

- Display input fields for entering user details:
  - Username (text field)
  - Display Name (text field)
  - Phone (text field)
  - Email (text field)
  - User Roles (dropdown/select field with options: Guest, Admin, SuperAdmin)
  - Enabled (checkbox for user status)
- Validation:
  - Username, display name, email, and user roles are required fields.
  - Email field should be in a valid email format.
- Show appropriate error messages if validation fails.
- Upon successful submission:
  - Clear input fields.
  - Display a success message.
  - Optionally, provide an option to add another user without reloading the page.

### Edit User Form

- Similar to the New User form but with pre-filled input fields containing existing user details.
- Allow administrators to modify user details.
- Validation and submission behavior are the same as the New User form.

### User Roles Dropdown

- Provide a dropdown/select field for selecting user roles.
- Options: Guest, Admin, SuperAdmin.
- Default role: Guest.

## Initial State

- Upon loading the page, display the New User form.
- Input fields should be empty initially.
- Show a loading indicator while fetching data if necessary.

## Accessibility

- Ensure all UI components are accessible and keyboard navigable.
- Use appropriate labels and ARIA attributes for screen readers.

## Error Handling

- Display appropriate error messages if any operation (adding, editing users) fails due to server errors or validation errors.
